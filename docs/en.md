# PAJ GPS

Follow your PAJ GPS trackers (car, bike, people, pets, valuables) in Gladys:
position, speed, battery, last seen, distance to home and "at home", and the
alerts PAJ raises (SOS button, shock, low battery, zone...). Read only,
through the cloud of PAJ GPS (connect.paj-gps.de), with the account of the
PAJ app.

> This integration has never been tested with a real PAJ GPS tracker nor a
> real account: it follows the documented API of PAJ and the pajgps-api
> library. Please report what differs. Unofficial integration, not
> affiliated with PAJ.

## Setup

1. Fill in the **e-mail address** and the **password** of your PAJ GPS
   account (the ones you use in the PAJ app or on connect.paj-gps.de). The
   password is kept by Gladys in its database, never shown again, never
   logged, sent only to the PAJ GPS API.
2. Choose the **refresh** (5 minutes by default, never less) and the
   **"at home" radius** (200 m by default).
3. Save. Gladys reads the account, then the **Discovery** tab lists one device
   per tracker (20 at most): add the ones you want.

For the distance to home, give your house a position in Gladys
(**Settings > Houses**). On installation, Gladys asks you to let the
integration read the position of your houses: it is only used here, in your
Gladys, to compute the distances.

## What each tracker gives

| Feature          | What it is                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Latitude         | Last position known by PAJ (no history by default)                                  |
| Longitude        | Last position known by PAJ (no history by default)                                  |
| Speed            | km/h at the last position                                                           |
| Battery          | % (trackers with their own battery only)                                            |
| Last seen        | Date of the last position (UTC)                                                     |
| Distance to home | Meters to the nearest house of Gladys that has a position                           |
| At home          | 1 within the radius; 0 beyond the radius plus a margin (half of it, 100 m at least) |

A position is published once: a restart of the integration never sends an old
position again as a new one, a position older than the one shown (a late
upload of the tracker) is never published, and a position dated more than
5 minutes ahead of the clock of Gladys (a tracker with a wrong clock) is
ignored. Everything is read only: a tracker cannot be
switched, configured or located on demand from Gladys.

**Presence of a Gladys user.** Gladys cannot yet move a user on its map from
an integration: use the "At home" feature of the tracker in your scenes (for
example "when At home of the car becomes 1").

## The "PAJ GPS alert" scene trigger

It fires for each alert PAJ records for a tracker **created in Gladys**:
choose a tracker (or any) and an alert type (or any): SOS, shock (movement),
low battery, radius left, speed, power cut off, ignition, drop, zone entered,
zone left, voltage, turned off, other. The alerts are set in the PAJ app
(they must be turned on there). Variables: the tracker name, the alert type
and its time (UTC); never the position.

- Read at the refresh, so an alert arrives up to one interval late.
- Only alerts of the last hour fire; none for what happened before the
  tracker was created in Gladys or before the first reading. **With a refresh
  of 1 hour, an alert may never fire** (it can be just over an hour old when
  read): choose 30 minutes or less if you use this trigger.
- 30 events at most per reading (the most recent ones); nothing is marked
  read in PAJ. An alert route refused for one tracker (HTTP 401/403) only
  skips its alerts for that reading.

## Pace, failures and privacy

- **Pace.** One reading per interval: the trackers and their last positions
  (two requests), then one request per tracker created in Gladys for its
  alerts. Nothing reads sooner: neither the **Test the connection** button,
  nor Discovery, nor a reconnection, nor saving an unchanged configuration,
  nor a restart (the time of the last attempt is kept in `/data`).
- **Refused credentials.** When PAJ refuses the e-mail address or the
  password, nothing more is sent with them (a wrong password tried again and
  again may lock the account). Correct them and save, or click **Test the
  connection**: one more try, never sooner than the interval. A new token is
  asked at most once per reading when PAJ refuses the current one.
- **PAJ asks to wait** (HTTP 429, a server error): every request pauses
  (Retry-After when given, 6 h at most), even after a restart. A 403 page of
  a firewall pauses 6 h (not about the credentials).
- **Privacy.** Positions, tracker names and ids, the e-mail address, the
  password and the tokens are never logged nor written to disk by the
  integration. `/data` only keeps salted fingerprints, the time of the last
  attempt, a pause, and the dates of the last position and alert published.
  The positions published are kept by Gladys like any other value (without
  history unless you turn it on). The e-mail address and the password go in
  the address of the login request, as the PAJ API asks for them (over
  HTTPS, never logged by the integration). They may therefore appear in the
  access logs of PAJ or of its hosting: use a password for PAJ that you use
  nowhere else.
- **Unexpected login answer** (HTTP 404: the API may have changed): said as
  such, not as refused credentials; not tried again by itself.
- **Houses.** Read again at every reading: a house given a position later
  counts at the next reading. A restart keeps "at home" within the margin
  (the last value Gladys keeps).

## Limits

- 20 trackers at most per account (the ones created in Gladys first).
- A tracker reports its position at its own pace (PAJ settings), often less
  often than the refresh.
- Not tested with a real tracker (see above). The voltage of car trackers,
  the geofences and the trip history are not read (yet).
